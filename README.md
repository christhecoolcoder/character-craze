## What is Character Craze?
Character Craze is a video game trivia game the challanges your knowledge of popular video game characters. To prove youre the ultimate gamer you must complete each stage by entering the correct name for the silhouette of the character on screen. 5 incorrect guesses and you lose and must restart the game.

## Type Of Code:
This game consists of mostly html and css documents to add the general layout and look of the levels. several different javascript documents for each level are included too check the users and answers and play sounds or reveal hints.

The backgrounds are mostly photoshopped images that are meant as themes for each characters stage, they also serve as an additional hint about where the character is from.

## Controls:
the user simply needs to input the correct character in the input box to advance to the next level.
                                

## Glitches: 
the welcome screen title animation resizes quickly which makes it a bit less fluid but does not affect the functionality.
         
## Area for improvement:
I would like to add a score the is tracked across each page and adds or subracts as the player continues through the stages. as of now it just starts the next page with a preset score as if the player hasnt got any questions wrong.
